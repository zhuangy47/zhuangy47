I'm Yanni; I'm a Computer Science major at the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois.  

  
Currently, I'm a research intern at the Parallel Programming Laboratory at UIUC. I'm also involved in the Reflection|Projections Dev Team as a SWE and the AMD Security Team at Disruption Lab as a SWE. I'll also be a Course Assistant for CS128 starting this fall.
