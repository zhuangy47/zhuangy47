### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an MCS student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ðŸŒ½

Currently, I'm an graduate research assistant under Mariana Silva, where I work on improving PrairieLearn, an open-source learning platform. I've also been a part of the Parallel Programming Laboratory, where I tinker with the Charm++ framework. My interests generally lie in building scalable systems for large-scale computing applications. Previously, I was one of the infrastructure leads for CS341, and a course assistant for CS374, CS128 and CS433.

This past summer, I worked at Jump Trading, where I worked on performance optimizations for post-trade analysis pipelines.
The summer befoer that, I worked at Modern Treasury, where I redesigned a financial data ingestion system, 275x'ing its operating capacity.

I'm also the current Academic Committee Co-Chair of UIUC's Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) student chapter. In the past, I've been the Vice Chair for ACM and a member of the Reflection Projections development team, Disruption Lab, and the Illinois Space Society.
