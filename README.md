### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a junior studying computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign ðŸŒ½

Currently, I'm an undergraduate research assistant at the Parallel Programming Laboratory (PPL) where I tinker with the Charm++ framework. My interests generally lie in building scalable systems for large-scale computing applications. I'm also one of the lead course developers for CS341 and a course assistant for CS374. I was previously a CA for CS433, CS433.

Last summer, I worked at Modern Treasury, where I redesigned a financial data ingestion system, 275x'ing its operating capacity.

I'm also the current Vice Chair of UIUC's Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) student chapter. In the past, I've been an Academic Committee chair and a member of the Reflection Projections development team, Disruption Lab, and the Illinois Space Society.
